## 1. Introduction (Motivation & Context)  
A tutorial should always start with a clear objective – and ideally with a small spark of excitement.  

**Example:**  
“In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to publish your very first article in the CMS. By the end, your post will be live on the website – a small step in the tool, but a big leap in your communication work.”  

**Author’s note:**  
- Provide a simple storyline: *Who is doing what, and why?*  
- State the *concrete learning outcome* clearly.  
- Keep the tone inviting, not dry.

## 2. Prerequisites (What Do I Need?)  
Set out the minimal requirements before the user can begin.  

**Example:**  
- Login credentials for the CMS  
- User role “Editor” or higher  
- Title and draft text for the article prepared in advance  

**Author’s note:**  
- Only list what’s truly essential.  
- Short, clear, checklist style.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions (The Core)  
This is the heart of the tutorial: clear, linear instructions with no detours into theory.  

**Example:**  
1. Log in to the CMS.  
2. In the menu, go to **Content → Posts**.  
3. Click **New Post**.  
4. Enter the following details:  
   - **Title**: “Welcome to our new CMS!”  
   - **Content**: Paste in your prepared text  
   - **Image** (optional): Upload via *Add Media*  
5. Click **Save**.  
6. To make your article visible, select **Publish**.  

**Author’s note:**  
- Always use numbered, actionable steps.  
- Focus on *doing*, not explaining.  
- Each step should create something visible or verifiable.  

---

## 4. Outcome (Reward & Confirmation)  
Confirm the visible success at the end.  

**Example:**  
“Your article is now published and appears on the homepage. Well done – your CMS account has successfully launched its first live post!”  

**Author’s note:**  
- Make sure the accomplishment is obvious and measurable.  
- Close with a rewarding and encouraging tone.  

---

## 5. Further Links  
This is where you connect to the other Diataxis documents.  

**Example:**  
- **How-to guide:** “Editing a published article”  
- **Explanation:** “Why the CMS uses different publishing states”  
- **Reference:** “All field definitions for the Post module”  

**Author’s note:**  
- Always link to at least one item of each type.  
- This is how a coherent documentation system is built.

# Summary for Authors  

A model **Diataxis tutorial** in the CMS context should always contain:  
1. **A motivating start** (*Why does this matter?*)  
2. **A short prerequisites list** (*What do I need first?*)  
3. **A linear, step-by-step walkthrough**  
4. **A confirmation of success**  
5. **Cross-references to other document types**  

The goal: users don’t need to *learn the entire CMS*, they just need to succeed in **one clearly defined scenario** – ideally with a touch of satisfaction rather than frustration.
